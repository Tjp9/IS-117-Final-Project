        What is an Operating System
    </h2>

    <h3 id="opD">
        An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer.
        It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.
        It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.
        Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

                <h5>
                    Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s.
                    There have been many different versions of Windows,

                    Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009).
                    Windows comes pre-loaded on most new Laptops , which helps to make it one of

                    created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all Macintosh computers,

                <h5>
                    Linux (pronounced LINN-ux) is a family of open-source operating
                    systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by
                    anyone around the world. This is different from proprietary
                    software like Windows, which can only be modified by the company
                    that owns it. The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and
                    there are many different distributions or versions you can choose
                    from.
